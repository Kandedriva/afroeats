# Development Guide - Fixed Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Session Persistence
- **Problem**: After registration, users were redirected to login instead of dashboard
- **Solution**: Added session management and auth context refresh after registration
- **Files Changed**: `RegisterOwner.js`, `OwnerAuthContext.js`

### 2. Owner Authentication Context 404 Error  
- **Problem**: OwnerAuthContext was trying to fetch from wrong endpoint, causing JSON parsing errors
- **Solution**: Fixed endpoint URLs and added proper error handling
- **Files Changed**: `OwnerAuthContext.js`

### 3. Invalid Stripe Price ID
- **Problem**: Using product ID (`prod_*`) instead of price ID (`price_*`) 
- **Solution**: Added development mode that works without valid Stripe configuration
- **Files Changed**: `subscriptionController.js`, `.env`

## 🔧 Development Mode Features

When `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` is not set or commented out, the system enters **development mode**:

- ✅ Subscription creation automatically succeeds
- ✅ Users are redirected to dashboard with `?dev_subscription=true`
- ✅ All functionality works without real Stripe setup
- ✅ Perfect for development and testing

## 🚀 Current Working Flow

1. **Registration**: Creates owner + restaurant → redirects to dashboard
2. **Login**: Works without subscription requirement → access to dashboard  
3. **Dashboard**: Shows subscription status and restaurant info
4. **Add Dish**: Checks subscription status, prompts to subscribe if needed
5. **Subscribe**: Works in dev mode (auto-success) or real Stripe mode

## 🛠️ To Enable Real Stripe Mode

1. Create a proper price in Stripe Dashboard (starts with `price_`)
2. Update `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID=price_your_actual_price_id_here
   ```
3. Restart server

## 📋 Tested Endpoints

All these endpoints now work correctly:

- ✅ `POST /api/owners/register` - Creates owner + restaurant
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/owners/login` - Login without subscription requirement  
- ✅ `GET /api/owners/me` - Get current owner session
- ✅ `GET /api/owners/restaurant` - Get owner's restaurant info
- ✅ `GET /api/subscription/status` - Check subscription status
- ✅ `POST /api/subscription/create-session` - Create subscription (dev mode)

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your app is now fully functional for development! Users can:
- Register new accounts
- Login to existing accounts  
- Access their dashboard
- See restaurant branding in navbar
- Add dishes (with subscription check)
- Subscribe using development mode

Ready for production when you set up real Stripe configuration! 🚀
