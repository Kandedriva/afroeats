# Subscription Issue Fix Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Authentication Middleware**
- **Problem**: Subscription routes were missing owner authentication middleware
- **Fix**: Added `requireOwnerAuth` middleware to subscription routes
- **Files Changed**: `backend/routes/subscriptionRoutes.js`

### 2. **Context Authentication Flow**
- **Problem**: OwnerAuthContext was trying to fetch subscription status before owner was fully authenticated
- **Fix**: Separated subscription status fetching from initial auth check
- **Files Changed**: `afro-eats/src/context/OwnerAuthContext.js`

### 3. **Function Name Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Multiple `fetchSubscriptionStatus` functions causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Renamed local functions and used context functions properly
- **Files Changed**: `afro-eats/src/pages/OwnerDashboard.js`

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Subscription controller didn't handle database errors gracefully
- **Fix**: Added try-catch blocks and proper error responses
- **Files Changed**: `backend/controllers/subscriptionController.js`

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Make sure both servers are running:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # Frontend  
   cd afro-eats && npm start
   ```

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/owner/login`
   - Log in as a restaurant owner
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Try to subscribe (it should now work without 500 errors)

## üîç If Still Getting Errors

The most likely remaining issue is **session persistence**. Check:

1. **Owner is actually logged in**: Check browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies to see if session cookie exists
2. **Session secret matches**: Make sure `SESSION_SECRET` in `.env` matches what was used to create the session
3. **Database session table**: Check if the `session` table exists in PostgreSQL

### Quick Session Debug:
```javascript
// Add this to any owner route to debug sessions:
console.log("Session Debug:", {
  sessionExists: !!req.session,
  ownerId: req.session?.ownerId,
  sessionId: req.sessionID
});
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ `/api/subscription/status` should return `{active: false}` for non-subscribed owners
- ‚úÖ `/api/subscription/create-session` should create Stripe checkout session
- ‚úÖ After payment, owner should be marked as subscribed
- ‚úÖ Dashboard should show subscription status correctly

The authentication flow has been fixed and should now work properly!
